        <p>My name's Joy Ani. I'm a comdes major and a junior.</p>
        <p>I'm taking this class because it's required for my major.</p>
        <p>I don't rlly have that much experience outside of customization my profile on sites like artfight or deviantart.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn effective ways to organize a website when folders are involved.</p>
        <p>I expect it to be different in the fact that I can't see the results of my work immediatly</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.itousa.jp/">Itousa</a> I love Itousa's choice of design in general. 
        All the elements on her page, such as her icons or the background pattern, are really cohesive. 
        I also like how on her shopping page, you're able to see multiple images at once.</p>
        <p><a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> The texts at the bottom of the page is really easy to read, and the images aid
        in the this explanation. The colors chosen contrast well enough that they aid in legibility without
        becoming an eyesore.</p>

        I think everything is organized really well. It's nice that "portolio" leads to it's own page but still
        provides a dropdown menu.
