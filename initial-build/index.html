All other mainline games are also released 
                <br>
                The original games contained 151 species of Pokemon, but since each generation introduced more species, there are now  1,025 species as of January 2025.

                    </ul>
                    </p>
                <p>Trainer's pokemon can engage in battles against opposing pokemon and use items to their advantage. Pokemon faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Poké Center.
